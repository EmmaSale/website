                Crab Isle was a submission to the I Can't Draw But I want To Make A Game(Again) Jam. Its was the first game I released that I was properly happy with. This game was my first introduction to many things I would continualy reuse later: Circle fade in/outs, save systems, cutscenes, enemy spawning system and the camera system
